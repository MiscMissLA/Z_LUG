Hackathon Pitch ‚Äì Shape-from-Shading Solution


üîç Problem: 
Current lunar terrain reconstruction techniques using Shape-from-Shading (SfS) assume the Sun‚Äôs direction is known and accurate. However, this metadata is often noisy, missing, or incorrect ‚Äî especially in older or polar mission datasets. This leads to inaccurate DEMs (Digital Elevation Models), especially in shadowed or complex lighting areas.

üí° Our Idea (Cause ‚Üí Effect):
We propose a method to **self-estimate the Sun‚Äôs direction directly from the image itself**, rather than blindly trusting the metadata. This allows us to apply SfS reliably even when the original data is missing, faulty, or distorted. As a result, we can generate **more accurate DEMs** using only a single mono image, with improved robustness to lighting errors and surface albedo variation.


1. Rough Idea (Pipeline)

1. **Input & Preprocessing**
   - Load mono lunar images (TMC-2, LRO NAC) with any available Sun metadata
   - Clean the image: remove striping/noise, convert brightness to reflectance

2. **Self-Calibrating Sun Direction Estimation** ‚úÖ *Novel Block*
   a. **Brightest Pixel Heuristic**: Gradually increase brightness until top 0.1% pixels saturate ‚Üí use their location to estimate Sun direction
   b. **Shadow Geometry Refinement**: Measure length/angle of crater shadows to fine-tune Sun elevation angle
   c. **Optional Tiny CNN**: Train a small neural network on clean images with known lighting to predict Sun azimuth/elevation automatically

3. **Albedo-Aware Correction**
   - Detect unusually bright regions that might indicate high-albedo (not slope) and mask them to avoid slope errors

4. **Shape-from-Shading Core**
   - Use the corrected Sun direction + cleaned image to run a classical SfS algorithm
   - Outputs high-resolution relative elevation map and surface normals

5. **Anchor to Absolute Heights**
   - Tie the result to LOLA or SLDEM coarse DEMs to convert relative shape to absolute elevations

6. **Visualization**
   - Package the result as a DEM GeoTIFF and 3D hillshade view
   - Optionally display in QGIS or browser for demo purposes

2. USP (Uniqueness)

‚úÖ We break the field‚Äôs assumption: ‚ÄúSun direction is known.‚Äù
‚úÖ We work with just **a single image** ‚Äî no stereo required.
‚úÖ We build an **adaptive and self-correcting SfS module**.
‚úÖ Our pipeline handles **albedo variations** and shadows better.
‚úÖ The tool can be integrated into existing QGIS or mission pipelines.
‚úÖ It is light enough to run on laptops and even onboard systems.

3. Plan for Hackathon

Goal: Submit the **idea with a proof-of-concept pipeline outline**. Actual implementation can follow.

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Day 1 | Finalize data format, test image brightness scaling, draft Sun estimation logic |
| Day 2 | Validate crater shadow-based refinement; sketch CNN plan (optional); write up assumptions |
| Day 3 | Assemble visuals, pipeline diagram, and presentation with technical explanation |

Data required: 2‚Äì3 high-quality LRO NAC mono images with visible craters + LOLA DEM samples


4. Feasibility (Reality Check)

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî the idea is grounded in current challenges
‚úÖ A demo of the Sun direction estimation method alone would be valuable
‚úÖ SfS implementation can use existing solvers ‚Äî not reinvented
‚úÖ Success = show your Sun estimation improves DEM results or shadow alignment

‚ö†Ô∏è Watch out for:
- High-albedo confusion (can be handled with masking)
- Shadow edge accuracy (choose clear crater examples)
- Time limit: skip CNN if needed, focus on core idea

üéØ Final Verdict:
This is a **real, novel, and achievable research-oriented solution**. It addresses a serious gap in current planetary imaging pipelines and could lead to publishable work or adoption by agencies if refined further.
